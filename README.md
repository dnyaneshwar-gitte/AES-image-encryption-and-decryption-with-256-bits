Project Name: AES image encryption and decryption [256-bits]  
Project Overview: Cryptography and Network Security   

This project focuses on implementing 256-bit encryption to ensure data safety and security, particularly in handling image files. The primary aim is to understand how data is secured in real-life scenarios and to gain hands-on experience with the Kali Linux operating system. The project involves both encryption and decryption processes, utilizing various Python libraries.  

Project Steps:  
Image Selection: Choose an image from the folder.  
Password Entry: Input a password for encryption.   

Encryption Process:  
The encryption process begins, with the time taken dependent on the size of the image.  

Four files are generated:  
Secret image  
Visual encryption image  
2-share encryption image  
project.crypt (the 256-bit encrypted image)  

Decryption Process:  
Select the encrypted image.  
Input the password used during encryption.  
The image will be decrypted and restored to its original state. 

System Requirements:  
Operating System: Kali Linux on Oracle VirtualBox (recommended to avoid unexpected errors).  
Python Version: 3.10.1  

Libraries Used:  
NumPy 1.13.3  
Pillow 9.0.0  
PyCryptodome 3.12.0  
Tkinter  

This project is a practical implementation of cryptographic principles, demonstrating how data can be securely encrypted and decrypted using modern encryption techniques.
