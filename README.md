Basically project is based on cryptography and network security. We successfully created this project with 256 bits of encryption.This project help to obtain data safty and security. Our basic aim to create this project to get idea about kali linux operating system and how data is being secured in reallife.  

project steps:  
1. select image from folder  
2. enter password  
3. for encrypt  
4. take some time as per size of image  
5. create 4 images [secret image, visual encryption image, 2-share encryption, project.crypt]  
6. project.crypt is encrypted image with 256 bits  
7. for decryption  
8. select encrypted image  
9. enter password  
10. image will decrypt  

Recommended to used Linux based machine to avoid unexpected errors.
